# cs2svg.otf
OTF font cs2svg containing all SVG icons from the game in their original colors. Suitable for viewing and reusing in-game vector assets packaged as a font.

To use it with ImGui, SVG rendering is required - for example, integrating PlutoSVG with ImGui (or another SVG renderer), since ImGui does not natively support SVG fonts.
